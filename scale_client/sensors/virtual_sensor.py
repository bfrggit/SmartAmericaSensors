    VirtualSensors represent an abstract sensor feed, which may be raw data coming directly from a device, data
    coming from a remote device, or even events detected by other VirtualSensors.

    you may want to make use of functions such as on_start() to initiate connections to any 'physical' sensor devices,
    which may include opening connections to e.g. Twitter feeds.  Use a VirtualSensor when you want to make use of its
    added convenience functions, none of which are necessary to implement.
